Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, ResNet and AlexNet = chow chow vs. VGG = schipperke


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: All 3 identified the other animal and object as not dog, however, AlexNet classified the bucket as a cup which is incorrect


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
Conclusion- Best performance VGG model, dog image chosen = Finnish spitz

AlexNet and ResNet identified both dogs as breed chow chow – this is not a good breed match!. AlexNet also classified a bucket as a cup. 

All models correctly classified the black bear.

VGG identified both dogs as breed schipperke – this is actually related to finnish spitz and visually is almost identical. This is a better match.
