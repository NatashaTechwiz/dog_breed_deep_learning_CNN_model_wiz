Conclusion: Best performance VGG model 

Conclusion based in 2 main objectives:
1.Identifying which pet images are of dogs and which pet images aren't of dogs

2.Classifying the breeds of dogs, for the images that are of dogs

For objective 1; both VGG and AlexNet correctly identify images of "dogs" and "not-a-dog" 
100% of the time.

For objective 2; VGG provides the best solution because it classifies the correct breed of dog over 90% of the time.

Data set = uploaded_images

jpg of: 
-Black bear, 
-Bucket
-Same dog image; Finnish spitz (head on left orientation) and Finnish spitz (head on left orientation)

Notes:
Black bear filename = Black_bear_01.jpg
Bucket filename = Bucket_01.jpg
Finnish spitz dog are identical images with different orientation.
files named as Dog_01.jpg (head on left orientation) 
and Dog_02.jpg (head on right orientation)

Conclusion: Best performance VGG model

AlexNet and ResNet identified both dogs as breed chow chow – this is not a good breed match!. AlexNet also classified a bucket as a cup. 

All models correctly classified the black bear.

VGG identified both dogs as breed schipperke – this is actually related to finnish spitz and visually is almost identical. This is a better match.
